1.)
Adds listener to all elements inside the table
Prediction: When those elements are clicked they will produce an alert -
  - with its innerHTML displayed
Outcome: correct

2.)
Listener added to all table-internal elements, table row elements, and tables
order of nesting is
 tables
 |--table row
    |--table d
Prediction: Alert will display:
  - internal of td, then tr, then table
Outcome: Mostly correct
 - table is also clickable and will only produce a dialogue of itself when clicked
 - table row cannot be clicked
 - table d is as prediction

3.)
Before uncommenting e.stopPropagation();
Listener added to all table-internal elements, table row elements, and first row of table
tables
|--table row
   |--table d
Prediction: Alert will display:
  When top row is clicked:
    - internal of td, then tr, then table
  When bottom row is clicked:
    - internal of td, then tr
  Should reflect outcome of trial 2
Outcome: Incorrect
- both rows display similar behavior
- table, then td, then tr

After uncommenting e.stopPropagation();
Prediction: Only one alert will show up: table.
Outcome: Correct
* note: table has extra tag tbody, when generated in the dom.

4.)
Prediction: Uncommenting e.stopPropagation() will show only the first event alert
Outcome: Correct
Order of listeners are are added as normal.
Prediction: Order off addition does not matter
Outcome: incorrect?
- displays in order of last added, which is equal to hierarchy of dom.

Testing rearranging adding.
- Add table put first.
Prediction: Order of addition will not matter, only dom hierarchy.
Outcome: correct?
- follows dom hierarchy

Testing rearranging adding.
- Add table row put first.
Prediction: Order of addition will not matter, only dom hierarchy.
